# Guild Wars 2 - Mouse fix
AHK script for fixing the issue in Guild Wars 2 with your mouse moving when you're rotating the camera.

# Is it safe?
I can NOT guarantee that you won't be banned for using this script, so don't blame me if something happens.
But according to this page https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013762153-Policy-Macros-and-Macro-Use the use of macros is allowed,
as long as they don't give advantage over other players or automate the gameplay. In this case the macro simply fixes a bug,
which means it actually makes sure your game is running exactly as intended, thus I doubt it can be considered a bannable macro.
I still make no promises though :)

# How to use?
1. Place the script in its own folder.
2. Create a shortcut to Guild Wars 2's executable file next to the script and name the shortcut "gw2".
3. Create a shortcut of the script anywhere you want and launch the script from the shortcut.
4. You can even change the script's icon to Guild Wars 2 icon.

# Something doesn't work?
Create an issue in this project and I'll take a look.
